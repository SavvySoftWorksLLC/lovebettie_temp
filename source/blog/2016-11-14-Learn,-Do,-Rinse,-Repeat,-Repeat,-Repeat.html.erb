While they are not exactly mirror images anyone who has seen my site here and the <a href="http://savvysoftworks.com" target="_blank">SavvySoftWorks</a> website can see some similarities. This resemblance extends beyond the fact that I created both sites, it had more to do with learning and exploring. As well as a well timed facelift.
</p>
<p>
When I was tasked with building the SavvySoftWorks site, I was given a few parameters to work within. A <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/" target="_blank">Middleman</a> backbone, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulSCoder" target="_blank">Paul Scarrone</a> wanted to try incorporating <a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">Materialize</a> for the styling. I had tinkered with Middleman in the past, but mostly this would be all new learning.
</p>
<p>
Building out the SavvySoftWorks site was a great experience, learning the new frameworks, hearing design tips passed from professional designers to Paul throughout his career. The only problem was there was more to explore with Materialize than I needed. So... I decided my ultra basic personal webpage could 
use a facelift as well. So I began my sites personal revamp in the evenings.
</p>
<p>
This site now incorporates a Middleman backbone as well as Materialize. Redundant? well yes, but it allowed me to deeper explore Materialize which has benefited both sites, as well as created a greater understanding of both frameworks. This process not only yielded two nice looking sites it created a place for learning, practice, and application of what was learned. Resulting in me feeling very comfortable with my ability to build out sites using this method. Which allows me to focus on the site and the product, instead having to focus on the code continuously.

<p>
Now it is not always possible to work on two similar projects like this at the same time. Though if that opportunity arises, I recommend you take it. The learning I was able to accomplish by doing both the sites simultaneously was fantastic and it's knowledge I have put to work quickly and efficiently several times already, both personally and professionally.

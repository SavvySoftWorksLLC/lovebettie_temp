        Existing Ruby on Rails website of the one and only Savannah Butler. I was tasked with revamping several features of the site as well as updating the styles of certain sections. I started with rebuilding the mobile navigation of the website. Then, using the SavvyMailer service, I also revamped the contact form and updated its style as well as the style of a few other sections of the site. Additionally I built a blog feature for the website so Savannah can share her adventures with the world. More updates are in the works.

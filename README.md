# Lovebettie

### Lovebettie's Temporary Landing Page

Build with Middleman Ruby and Materialize

###### Needs
- Confirmation CNAME file works as intended
- GMail login to set up calendar
- SavvyMailer Account

###### Questions
- Photo OK? Should we stick to a duo photo? Do we have a duo photo?
- Do we need to contact the Google???

###### Note to bossman
- Middleman and gh-pages was giving me issues publishing, so I rebuilt it using my site as the base. We may need to keep this in mind for future sites we work on.
